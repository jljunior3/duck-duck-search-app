## Duck Duck Search App

**Full-stack web application that allows users to perform intelligent searches (using duckduckgo api) and store history
using a modern stack
with NestJS (back-end) and React (front-end).**

ðŸ”´**Back-end**: Built with nest.js and hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters), this way we have flexibility when
changing, for example, the type of history file from json to redis or database.

and
dynamic interfaces.
